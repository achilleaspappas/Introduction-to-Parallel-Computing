# Introduction to Parallel Computing

The purpose of this project is to implement parallel algorithms using MPI. The source code files address different exercise problems. This project was part of a course I did in my 5th semester.

## Prerequisites

To use the files in this repository, you will need the following:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) in order to run MPI files
- [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) in order to run MPI files

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code file using the appropriate compiler and compile flags. 
    ```
    mpicc file.c -o file
    ```
3. Run the executable file generated by the compilation process.
    ```
    mpirun -np X ./file
    ```
    X equal to the number of processes.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:
1. Source_Code_1.c
2. Source_Code_2.c

## Specifications

### Functionality

### Exercise - Source_Code_1.c

You are asked to make an MPI program (in C language and assuming point-to-point
communication), which, given (as input) a vector X (length n elements xi | i=0‚Ä¶n-1), calculates in
parallel in an environment of 'p' processors and print to the screen (as output) the following:

- the mean value of the elements of the vector X:

```
m = (x0 + x1 + x2 + ‚Ä¶ + xn-1) / n
```
- the dispersion of the elements of the vector X:

```
var = ((x0 ‚Äì m) 2 + (x1 ‚Äì m) 2 + (x2 ‚Äì m) 2 + ‚Ä¶ + (xn-1 ‚Äì m)2) / n
```

- a new vector D where each element Œ¥i will be equal to the percentage relation of the
corresponding element (Xi) of the vector X to the difference of the maximum-minimum values of
the entire vector X:

```
Œ¥i = ((xi ‚Äì xmin) / (xmax ‚Äì xmin)) * 100
```

Use only simple communication functions like MPI_Send()/MPI_Recv() (do not use collective communication functions).

### Exercise - Source_Code_2.c

A matrix A(NxN) is called strictly diagonally dominant if for each row of the matrix
A:

You are asked to write and run an MPI program in C (assuming a parallel
environment of p processors), which, given a two-dimensional array A(NxN):

- It will initially check in a parallel way whether the array A is strictly diagonally
dominated (processor '0' should read from the screen the array A and at the end
print the result ‚Äì 'yes' or 'no').

```
|ùõ¢ùëñùëñ| > ‚àë |ùê¥ùëñùëó| where j=0‚Ä¶N-1 i<>j
```

-  In the case that this is true (i.e. the matrix A is strictly diagonally dominated)
the program should then calculate in parallel the maximum absolute value element
of the diagonal of the matrix 

```
A (m = max(|Aii|)
```

- And then on the basis of this (m) to create in parallel a new matrix B √øxN
(which will also be printed by '0' at the end on the screen) where:

```
Bij = m ‚Äì |Aij| for i<>j and Bij = m for i=j
```

Use only collective communication functions in your program.
